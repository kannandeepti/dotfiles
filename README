Feel free to use the install.sh script to install them, but make sure you
make your own branch and whitelist by deleting the ones you don't want first,
since various of the files have hardcoded paths that may case SERIOUS DAMAGE if
misused.

Also, make sure to do something like the following to see what you're installing

for file in `ls dotfiles`; do
    diff -r "dotfiles/$file" "$HOME/.$file" >>install_dry_run.diff
done
